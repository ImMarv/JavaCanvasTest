# JavaCanvasTest
A simple project that implements a drawing canvas.
This app is one part of a bigger project I am working on.
Things that the add will include are:

- A simple pen and eraser for drawing, allowing multiple types of brushes.
- Being able to adjust the opacity of the pen and eraser
- An RGB color picker
- A build shape tool, allowing to draw any simple shapes
- Fill bucket tool
- Layers
- Lasso tools to mask certain parts of a project.
- Type-setting.

**This is a project made to learn! I am always open to feedback and help :)**
